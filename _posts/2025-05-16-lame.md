Today we will work a way out on LAME, which is a popular box on HTB. Letâ€™s not waste any time and get directly into the box

## RECONNAISSANCE
I started by performing a service version and script scan on the target using nmap.

I looked for ways to exploit the low hanging SMB and found a [tool](https://github.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447?source=post_page-----ea7fcec34f25---------------------------------------) on GitHub.
I downloaded this onto my system and ran it.

```sh
nc -lvnp 1337
```

I directly gained root access. Next I spawned a TTY shell for better usability

Finally, I looked into the directories in /home and found the user flag in /home/makis.

and since I was a root user, I went into the root directory and found the final flag as well.
