Today we will work a way out on **Lame**, which is a popular box on HTB. Letâ€™s not waste any time and get directly into the box.

## RECONNAISSANCE

Let's first fire up our Nmap scan to get a glance at the machine's setup (full port scan so we donâ€™t miss anything ðŸ˜‰):

![first_nmap](/assets/img/htb-machines/lame/nmap_first.png)

Weâ€™ve got a few interesting services running on Lame. Letâ€™s dig deeper.  
We'll do a version scan to identify the exact service versions:

Let's visit the FTP server and see if it allows anonymous login:

```sh
ftp 10.10.10.3                                                                       
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)

ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||55336|).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> cd ..
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp> pwd
Remote directory: /
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||42798|).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
```

Seems like nothing is there. Let's start enumerating services for CVEs.  
Starting with SMB:

![smb](/assets/img/htb-machines/lame/smb.png)

I think Samba 3.0.20 is vulnerable. Letâ€™s first see if it has any open shares:
```sh
smbclient -L 10.10.10.3 -N
Anonymous login successful

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
	tmp             Disk      oh noes!
	opt             Disk      
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))
	ADMIN$          IPC       IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
Anonymous login successful

	Server               Comment
	---------            -------

	Workgroup            Master
	---------            -------
	WORKGROUP            LAME

```

We see two interesting shares. Let's dig into them:
```sh
smbclient \\\\10.10.10.3\\tmp -N -c "ls"

Anonymous login successful

  vgauthsvclog.txt.0                  R     1600  Mon May 19 16:55:29 2025

7282168 blocks of size 1024. 5386564 blocks available
```

Nothing looks super interesting, but let's try to download them anyway.  
Here's a bash one-liner to grab everything we can:
```sh
for f in $(smbclient \\\\10.10.10.3\\tmp -N -c "ls" | awk '{print $1}' | grep -vE '^\.$|^\.\.$'); do smbclient \\\\10.10.10.3\\tmp -N -c "lcd /tmp; get \"$f\"" && echo "[+] Got $f" || echo "[-] Failed $f"; done
```

Output:
```sh
Anonymous login successful
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED opening remote file \5571.jsvc_up
[-] Failed 5571.jsvc_up
Anonymous login successful
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED opening remote file \vmware-root
```

I was hitting file permission issues. I can see the files but can't read them (same for the `opt` share).
### CVE HUNTING

Now let's search for any known CVEs for Samba 3.0.20:

![ssearchsploit](/assets/img/htb-machines/lame/searchploit.png)

first two look interesting :
### Samba 3.0.10 < 3.3.5 - Format String / Security Bypass

A format string vulnerability in Sambaâ€™s logging functions allows attackers to craft malicious input that can bypass authentication or execute code under certain conditions.
### Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - Username Map Script Remote Code Execution

If the `username map script` parameter is enabled in the Samba configuration, it allows execution of arbitrary shell commands. By sending a specially crafted username that injects commands into this script,thus we can execute code on the server remotely .


## EXPLOITATION

let's fire up Metasploit(ðŸ¤­) to see if there is any available modules for them

![msfc](/assets/img/htb-machines/lame/msfc.png)

Looks like we got a match.

![msfc](/assets/img/htb-machines/lame/options.png)

finally we launch the exploit by running `run` 

![final](/assets/img/htb-machines/lame/final.png)

Weâ€™re in ðŸš©
