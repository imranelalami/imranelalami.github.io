#Hey, I’m Imran.

Welcome to my blog. I’m an aspiring pentester focused on:

 Network pentesting and Active Directory
 CTFs and wargames
 Learning new technologies and areas of IT

I mainly post here to track my progress and help others who are starting out in this field.
Nothing here is groundbreaking — I’m not reinventing the wheel — but it’s a real collection of things I learn, explore, and break.
