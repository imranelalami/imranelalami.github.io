#  Hey, I’m Imran

Welcome to my blog. I'm an Aspiring Pentester focused on:

- 🧠 CTF Writeups & Notes  
- 🛠️ Pentesting Stuff I Learn the Hard Way  
- 📚 Learning logs for future me (and maybe you)

I post here mainly to keep track of my own progress, and also to help people like me who are just getting into this field.  
Not everything here is groundbreaking — I know I’m not reinventing the wheel — but it’s real, it's a collection of the things I break and learn.
